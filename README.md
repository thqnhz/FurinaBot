## Self host

If you don't want to use my instance of the bot, you can host your own instace. Here are the step by step instructions:

> Requires Python 3.10+ (preferably newest stable)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/thanhz/FurinaBot.git
    cd FurinaBot
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    > Venv is recommended!
    >
    > I use `pyproject.toml` instead of `requirements.txt`, so it is pretty straight forward

    ```bash
    # using python
    python -m pip install .
    # using uv
    uv pip install .
    ```

3. Configure the bot:

    - Create a `.env` file to store your secrets

    ```env
    BOT_TOKEN=...
    WORDNIK_API=...
    ```

    > These are the 2 minimum that you would need for the bot to work

    - Edit `core/settings.py` for your likings

4. Run the bot:

    ```bash
    python -m main.py
    ```

## Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Discord requires this to get the bot verified. So I'll just make this as easy to understand as possible

### Terms of service

- There isn't one.

### Privacy Policy

- The bot won't ask for your personal information whatsoever.

- It will only store either users' discord ID or what the user want it to store (using tag command).

- DM to the bot will be forwarded using discord forward feature tho. So about that.
